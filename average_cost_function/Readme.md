# Averaging cost functions

The goal of this sub-project is to average HORTON cost functions before fitting charges.

TODO Steps:
* read .h5 files into python
* play around with content: which objects, addition, division etc

	* output formatting
* automate search in folder structure and averaging
* test if averaged cost function is still valid input for HORTON
